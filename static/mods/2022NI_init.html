Voters rank their candidates in order of preference, and a candidate must reach a quota of those votes to be elected. This is calculated on the number of seats available and votes cast. The votes are initially allocated to each voters top choice, and if a candidate surpasses that quota then their excess votes are transferred to other candidates according to their preferences.<p>This system makes it easier for smaller parties to get seats, and very difficult for any party to win outrights. In Northern Ireland, parties usually allocate themselves to communities in Stormont; Republican, Unionist, and Crossbench to decide how they will work together and vote on legislation.</p>`;
