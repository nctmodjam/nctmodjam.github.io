Can Gore maintain the large but fragile lead he starts with? Can Quayle make his case to the American people that he's ready for the step up to POTUS?</p>",

With Pat Buchanan declining a run with the Reform Party to endorse him, the Republican party faithful are fired up and united behind Quayle. However, the thing most Americans know Quayle for is his numerous and embarrassing gaffes in office, from his misspelling of 'potato' to his feud with Murphy Brown. But if Quayle can get past all that, the prospect of a Quayle presidency- long derided by comedians - might not be so far-fetched.</p>",

Goreâ€™s father was also in Congress for many years, and he has himself been a well-respected VP, contrasting the record of Quayle.<br>Gore has a lot of options in his campaign. He can embrace the legacy of Clinton, for better or worse. Politically, he can run as a centrist, or move to the left and run as a more traditional liberal Democrat than Clinton did. The presence of the well-known Ralph Nader as a Green Party candidate complicates this decision, as this means that Gore is essentially campaigning on two fronts. Due to Quayle's poor history in the public eye, Gore starts out with a solid lead, but he has to be careful in order to not let it slip. Will Gore succeed and continue the Third-Way policies of Clinton, or will he fail to rise to the occasion?",
